      <p>
        This site was made by animal enthusiasts who wanted a little challenge practice setting up a database and website. Losing ones pet can be a very emotionally distressing event, even more so when not knowing where to turn for help. A lot of lost pet-groups are based on social media sites such as Facebook, and are particularly difficult to find if one is new to the area.
